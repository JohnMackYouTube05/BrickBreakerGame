# A Breakout clone I made for a school project!
Now available to the public.

This game uses [a modified graphics fork of Tkinter, which was made by a group of teachers at my school](https://github.com/bbrzuszk/pythonGraphics) to run. If you don't get the EXE version of the game, and instead download the code itself to run it, you **absolutely need** the graphics.py file included in the code for any of the other Python files to run, since they all call for the graphics file.

## Controls:
A/D - Move Player Paddle Left/Right

Left Click - Fire Ball

## How to Download
In order to get this game running on your computer, you have 2 options:
1. You can download one of the releases I provide in the Releases tab, and run the self-extracting EXE to get all of the necessary files into one folder.
2. You can download the source code, and run it through the command line (you must have Python 3 installed to use this method instead). By going into a Command Prompt or Terminal window, and in the directory you downloaded the game to, type `python BrickBreakerGame.py`
